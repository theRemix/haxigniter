Really quick start
==================
If you're an experienced programmer and know web server configuration, here's 
a really quick start. All paths and file references will be relative to this
directory (where the README file is).

1. "src/haxigniter/application" is where your application is, and where you will 
deploy most of your code. The first thing you should do is to look through the 
file "src/haxigniter/application/config/Config.hx" to see what you can 
configure, especially the "development" setting. Everything is set up to just 
work for most systems, so hopefully you don't have to change anything.

2. Goto the "tools" dir and if you're on Windows, run "build.bat". Linux users 
executes "./build.sh" of course. If you're targeting neko, use "build.bat -neko".

3. If no errors, you now have a haXigniter-app in the "bin/www" directory. Copy 
the contents of "bin/www" to the root of a web server directory. (index.php and 
the lib dir)

4. Browse to the web server. If everything worked, you will now see the start 
page where you can experiment further.

5. If you're using FlashDevelop, there is a project file for your convenience: 
"src/haxigniter.hxproj".

6. The next thing to do is to look at the files in 
"src/haxigniter/application/controllers" for an explanation how to call the 
controllers. Or you can go on a guided tour here:

Good luck, and thanks for your interest!
